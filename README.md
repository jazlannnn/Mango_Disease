# Mango_Disease

## Introduction

The detection of plant diseases in modern agriculture is important, as an early 
detection can avoid substantial yield loss. Mango trees are widely grown in tropical 
regions where is susceptible to many diseases, which may affect fruit quality and 
quantity. Disease diagnosis using traditional methods is usually labour expensive and 
susceptible to human error (Wang et al., 2018). As demand for more efficient 
agricultural practises rises, the need for automated disease detection systems is 
constantly on the rise.

Technologies Used : Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Python, Streamlit, Tensorflow, Numpy, Pil, Keras,

## Conclusion

The Mango Leaf Disease Classifier is an AI-powered web app built with Streamlit that allows users 
to upload images of mango leaves and classify them into disease categories, 
including Anthracnose, Bacterial Canker, Cutting Weevil, Die Back, Gall Midge, or Healthy. 
The app uses a pre-trained TensorFlow deep learning model to process the image and 
provide a prediction along with a confidence score, offering an easy 
and interactive way to diagnose mango leaf diseases.
